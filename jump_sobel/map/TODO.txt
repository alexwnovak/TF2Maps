# Done

- Try adding some metal reflecty borders for visual accent
- Double check solid entrance tops
- 2 entrance is slightly off grid (see gap in bottom front left corner)
- 7 entrance leaks light
- 8 entrance leaks light
- 9 entrance leaks light
- Re-inspect all chutes for light-bleed (some do)
- 10 exit chute bottom is solid
- Reflections on metal? (Especially door frames) / Capture point reflections?
   * Seems like it's latching onto the env_cubemap for the capture point
   * Compile, load, buildcubemaps, disconnect, reload map (takes a second--loading cubemaps??)
- Lobby entrance to first jump chute bleeds light
- "Join Red" texture alignment vertically
- Trigger hurts in addition to func_regen
- Skip platform on 9 needs details
- #5 jump is too far
- Glass pipes on 7 look weird with PURE GLASS
- Weird triangle light on the other side of #5 entrance
- Door on 6 has a gap on top
- Add anti-telesync to each
- Avoid duplicate spawns
- Soundscapes
- Tidy up the lobby
- Tidy up Blue Spawn
- 3D Skybox - Skip - It isn't required enough to paint the environment
- Build the bonus - Skip - I wish, but I don't have the brush capacity :(
- Frogs may be too dark
- Spectator angles
- Manitou prop
- The capture point won't capture
- Need lights over the capture point
- Capture point ramp-to-exit is slightly too high
- Regen model
- Jump 10 doesn't have clip brushes!
- Build the capture point
   * Details
   * Use natural lighting to mirror the lobby
   * FIVE frogs
- Double-check for dupe spawns/light_env's from copy/pasting
- Regens for each jump
- Lobby ceiling lights look dumb
- Entrance room lights are busted triangles in a couple jumps--back with regular blocks?
   1. 1L
   6. 3L
   9. 3L, 5R
   10. 4L, 2R
- Exit platform on #5 sinks into the floor a little bit
- Fix the launch from #5
- Hook up the door
	* Should trigger open on its own
- Try giving a secondary hexagon inset to the wall pattern--with shiny metal reflections??
- Add the exit chamber with the chute
	* Still needs proper lighting
	* Needs something else to break up the plainness
- Add more detail to the mid-gray wavy walls at the exit
- Gussy up the edgebug platform
	* Give it a better shape (thickness is good I think)
	* Attach some particles to it to justify it floating on its own
- Add floor lights to the starting corridor (currently way too dark)
- Add the entrance chute
- Figure out a reusable pattern for jump numbers and QR codes maybe?
- Try less opacity still on the glass texture to let the rock show through
	* Still want to see the blue tint of the glass though!
- Overhead lighting in the jump starting
- MAYBE floor lighting at the chute exit floor
- Shoot-through walls and player clips
- Red spawn
- Blue spawn
