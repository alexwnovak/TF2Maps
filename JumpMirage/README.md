Jump Mirage
===========

This ended up being a huge undertaking. The scope was huge, and the design more complex. I used all
custom textures, custom sounds, custom props, and loads of detail. This map also features connectors,
instead of teleport doors, which added a ton of work. I built two entire routes with complete jumps
before building the third and final one. This is why it took a year. :(

Because of the complexity, I ran into Hammer limitations pretty frequently. This map took my
familiarity with Hammer and drove it into a new echelon. However, that took lots of time. The biggest
problem with development was the time I wasted repeating work. If I knew then all the things I learned
during this map, it would've taken a fraction of the time. But I love the result. It's not perfect,
but it's so much more than I thought I would accomplish.
