Jump Mirage Demos
=================

Originally I wanted to have "how to" videos for each jump. The idea is that I'd record them,
give some voice narration with further detail about how to do the jump, and maybe some help
about what to watch out for. Then they'd go on YouTube, but additionally I'd stick QR codes
at each jump IN the map (actual textures on the wall). That way as you're jumping, if you got
stuck you could use your phone to scan the code and get help without leaving the game.

I ended up making 16 demo files and getting all the video files done. But my trial to Vegas
ran out and I wasn't motivated to do the voice recording. Moreover, I didn't build each jump
with this in mind, so not all of them have reasonable places to actually put an easy-to-spot
QR code without it looking totally stupid. Eventually, I decided to cut it.

In this folder are the original TF2 Demos (.dem files) that I recorded for each jump. It's the
raw stuff that I used to cut together the per-jump tutorial videos. I didn't keep track of what
ticks I used, so if you really want to, you can watch me fail for a few minutes on some of
them. At least I got a few of the easy ones on the first try!

Under **TitleCard/** you'll find the Paint.NET project I threw together for each jump video's
intro. I'm not an artist, and I think it looks kinda funny. But whatever, there ya go.
