Jump Mirage Demos
=================

These are the original TF2 Demos (.dem files) that I recorded for each jump. It's the raw
stuff that I used to cut together the per-jump tutorial videos. I didn't keep track of what
ticks I used, so if you really want to, you can watch me fail for a few minutes on some of
them. At least I got a few of the easy ones on the first try!

Under **TitleCard/** you'll find the Paint.NET project I threw together for each jump video's
intro. I'm not an artist, and I think it looks kinda funny. But whatever, there ya go.
