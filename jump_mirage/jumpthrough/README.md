Jump Mirage Jumpthrough
=======================

This is the raw demo file that was used to produce the YouTube introduction jumpthrough.
Sorry for being sneaky, but it isn't a flawless run--I used a TAS plugin to record it. I
felt this was worth it, since this video would be plenty of people's first introduction to
jump_mirage, and I wanted it to be about the map itself. I find seams and cuts to be pretty
distracting, and it hurts the immersion. You're much more aware that you're watching
someone else's video on it, instead of being taken on a tour where you can sit back and
take in the visuals.
