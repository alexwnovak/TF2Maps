Jump NoName
===========

The first (barely) cohesive map I put together. I was brand new at Hammer and I took a stab at a
jump map. It has 13 jumps, is fullbright, and is very simple visually. Wouldn't say that I'm proud
of it, but hey, everyone starts somewhere.

The original idea was to test-pilot a real jump map under this name, post it on the jump.tf forums
(tf2jump, at the time), gather feedback and refine the map. _Then_, I'd have a polished enough product
and give it a real name. This is sort of how it went; I ditched the entire map and rebuilt from scratch
in what would become [jump_babylon](https://github.com/alexwnovak/TF2Maps/tree/master/JumpBabylon).
Note the re-use of a Skip to Double Speedshot.

Unfortunately, I can't find the VMF. I must've left it on my old machine. :(

Here's my original [introductory video run on YouTube](https://youtu.be/jdKy5mVarj4).
