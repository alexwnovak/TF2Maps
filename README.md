TF2 Jump Maps
=============

Here you'll find official builds of my maps, along with their "source"--the original VMFs, and
custom content (materials, sounds, etc). If you're curious how something works, you can pull it
down and open it up in Hammer. You can think of this like open source maps.

## Jump Mirage

This ended up being a huge undertaking. The scope was huge, and the design more complex. I used all
custom textures, custom sounds, custom props, and loads of detail. This map also features connectors,
instead of teleport doors, which added a ton of work. I built two entire routes with complete jumps
before building the third and final one. This is why it took a year. :(

Because of the complexity, I ran into Hammer limitations pretty frequently. This map took my
familiarity with Hammer and drove it into a new echelon. However, that took lots of time. The biggest
problem with development was the time I wasted repeating work. If I knew then all the things I learned
during this map, it would've taken a fraction of the time. But I love the result. It's not perfect,
but it's so much more than I thought I would accomplish.
