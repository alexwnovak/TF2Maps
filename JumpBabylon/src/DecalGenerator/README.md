Jump Babylon Decal Generator
============================

This is a little bit of code I wrote to generate decal images for use in my TF2 jump map, _jump_babylon_. The decals serve to number each jump in-game with a bit of visual style.

I'm definitely stronger with code than art programs, so here ya go.

Use it if you like, but it's not a usable "generator tool" in its current form. It's completely tied to my situation and requires code modifications to re-purpose it.

## The Project

It's a standard C# WinForms app, using GDI to draw a number and a dashed circle around it. The properties are configurable, but you may need to play with them to get it looking right if you want to dramatically change things.

## Feedback + Modifications

Feel free to fork and submit a pull request if you really want to extend it, or help turn it into a general-purpose decal generating tool. Observe the traditional GitHub etiquette, and I'm sure we'll get along just fine. :D
