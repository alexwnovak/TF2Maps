Jump Babylon
============

I consider this my first actual map. I was more familiar with Hammer, and not only _built_ a map,
but _designed_ one. There's a unified visual theme here with custom textures and moderately-complex
geometry. It's definitely not perfect: there are texture issues here and there, and the skill curve
gets kind of whack from #9 to #10 (a double, then a tele-sync), among other things. Felt like it was
well-received.
