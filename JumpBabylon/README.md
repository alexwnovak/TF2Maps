Jump Babylon
============

I consider this my first actual map. I was more familiar with Hammer, and not only _built_ a map,
but _designed_ one. There's a unified visual theme here with custom textures and moderately-complex
geometry. It's definitely not perfect: there are texture issues here and there, and the skill curve
gets kind of whack from #9 to #10 (a double, then a tele-sync), among other things. Felt like it was
well-received.

In **map/** you'll find the original VMF that you can open in Hammer. You'll also find directories for
**cfg**, **maps** (level sounds to disable resupply, pain grunts from players) and **materials**, the
custom textures in VMT and VTF form.

All this stuff should be enough for you to pull down and play around with the map, and run it yourself
on your machine.
